# My Portfolio

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I created it so you can learn more about me and explore some of the projects I've worked on. The website is built using React.js, which allows for easy organization of components. While the website is simple, it's designed to showcase my skills and experience as a developer. Each project page includes a brief description and links to live demos and GitHub repositories, so you can explore the projects in more detail.
